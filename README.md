# Loan-Prediction-using-ML

Project done in 2018

Dream Housing Finance company deals in all kinds of home loans. They have presence across all urban, semi urban and rural areas. Customer first applies for home loan and after that company validates the customer eligibility for loan.
Company wants to automate the loan eligibility process (real time) based on customer detail provided while filling online application form. These details are Gender, Marital Status, Education, Number of Dependents, Income, Loan Amount, Credit History and others. To automate this process, they have provided a dataset to identify the customers segments that are eligible for loan amount so that they can specifically target these customers. 
The data has 615 rows and 13 columns.

The goal of the project is to see whether the loan is approved or not. 

After exploration, I found certain aspects in the data 

A married, graduate has the highest probability of getting a loan
Males get more loan approvals compared to the females
A self- Employed individual has the least chance of loan approval
A man with a graduate degree has the highest income 
A married man has the highest income but a married woman has the least 

I applied Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Extreme Gradient Boosting and Adaptive Boosting to the data. 

Extreme Gradient Boosting has the most predictive power.
